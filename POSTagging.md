# POS Tagging #

A Part-Of-Speech Tagger (POS Tagger) is a piece of software that reads text in some language and assigns to each word (and other token), such as noun, verb, adjective, etc., although generally computational applications use more fine-grained POS tags like 'noun-plural'.

POS tag would be a useful feature since usage for several words varied. Past experiments with POS tagging in feature extraction for sentiment analysis have yield little improvements. The accuracy improves slightly for Naive Bayes classification.
